## Basic Idea

This App is used for **building tests in form of quizzes from the input of digital notes** or other materials. These are intended as study aids, not a testing framework for teachers and the student decides, whether his answer is good enough. The user can **choose from multiple file formats for his notes or textbooks**. From these, the marked sections of the text are made quiz questions and mostly based on headings, keywords and so on, a logical ordering of the questions is created.

For each quiz is than stored users score, history of answers, last state to be returned to and other quality of life features.
