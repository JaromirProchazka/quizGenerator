# Quiz Generator User Documentation

## Quiz Menu

At the Start of the App, you will be greeted by a list of your Quiz on top, and a `Create New Topic` button at the bottom. If you want to add a new topic, press the button and choose the method of providing the notes.

After that a new topic is added to the topics list at the top, or a topic with the same name is updated. Then select topic in list, you can then either click

- `Open` button and start the quiz,
- or click `Edit` button and an edit window will appear. You can **Rename** the topic or **Delete** it

### Quiz Creation

Now a chain of configuration pages will be shown in this order:

#### Choose Notes Source

You can either provide a local html file. In this case click the option and than press `Continue`. After that a file explorer window is shown where you can

Or give a link of a Notion page into the text field next to the Notion page option. Note that the page must be at the time of Creation PUBLIC.

Press `Continue` to move on to the next step.

#### Choose Question Format

Then you can choose the _Question format_, which are the attributes that if the given node in the source notes will have, it will be interpreted as the question and will be added to the final Quiz.

First you can choose if the conditions you give are supposed to be all present in the question node (AND) or if the any condition is sufficient (OR). There are these options for formatting the question node in the html file node:

- _Node name_: The name of the node. For instance stylistic nodes like `em` or `b`, or structural node names like lists
- _Node Color_: The inline color style in the node, for instance `blue` or `#ff0000`
- _Class_: Class names list that the node has separated with spaces, any of these classes present in node is will satisfy the condition
- _Font-Family_: inline Font family field

if the text field isn't written in, it is not used in the node analyzing.

After pressing `Continue`, new Topic is added to the Topics list where you can edit its name.

### Quiz Starting

On press of the `Open` button, the Topic selected in the Topics list will be opened. You will be presented with options of either continuing where you ended in your last test, or the option of starting from the beginning with 0 in the current question counter. After that your quiz is opened.

## Quiz Window

When the quiz is started, user is greeted on bottom with the question and answers window and on top with 4 buttons.

- press `Answer` button, and read your notes, which are shown at the bottom.
  - If you answer matches, press `Next üëç` which simply shows new question and increment counter.
  - If you failed to answer correctly, press the `Next üëé` button. This one also shows new question, but it moves the incorrectly answered question ahead, so that it will be asked again and hopefully answered correctly.
- when you are done and want to start a different quiz, simply press the `Back` button, which closes this quiz.

There is also a counter, which says ‚Äú`number of answered questions / number of questions`‚Äù. If you answer incorrectly and press `Next üëé`, the counter doesn‚Äôt increment.

## Testing Strategy

Unit tests for individual components and methods

## Database Schema

The Quiz Generator uses a file-based storage system for quiz data. The scheme consists of:

The topics folder contains styling and quiz visualization scripts. Further for each topic, there is a folder. Each folder containers an original notes file, the generated quiz file with the questions and answers and a serialized state file.

```
.sources\
        |-------‚Äî styles.css
        |-------‚Äî script.js
        |-------‚Äî *general topic folder\
                                    |-------‚Äî notes.html
                                    |-------‚Äî questions.html
                                    |-------‚Äî state.json
        |-------‚Äî ... more topic folders
```

## Modules Documentation

![QuizPersistence components diagram](https://github.com/JaromirProchazka/quizGenerator/blob/main/docs/ArchitectureDiagrams/L3.png?raw=true)

- **QuizPersistence:** Module that provides an interface for interacting with the Apps persistance. For example creating new Topics folder, renaming Topics...
  - **DataStructures:** Defines data structures useful for Questions Sequencing.
- **NotesParsing:** Defines tools for parsing notes into Quizzes. The questions are found using the **`QuestionNodeParams`** which holds the List of Attribute check classes. Each of these classes has a check for some possible html node attribute and on running the `QuestionNodeParams` function for analyzing the `HtmlNode`, each of these checks are used on the node. This insures great extensibility, new Check can be created by making inheriting object from the `BaseAttributeCheck` and it's instance be added to the Checks List. **`QuestionNodeParams` is abstract and has two inheritors**, the **`AndQuestionNodeParams`** and **`OrQuestionNodeParams`**. The And one passes, if all Checks in the List pass and the Or one passes if at least one check in the List passes.
- **AbstractChainStructure:**
  - **AbstractChain:** Defiens an abstract Chain of responsibility Pattern and its Builder.
- **TopicCreation:** Defines structures for Creating new Topics.
  - **TopicCreationChain:** This abstract chain and its builder are implemented by the **`TopicCreationStep : ChainStep<TopicProduct>`** and it's builder. This `TopicCreationStep` is implemented by the `ChooseQuestionFormat` which lets user configure the **`NotesParser`** and define what is interpreted as a question. Also there is the **`ChooseNotesSource : TopicCreationStep`** which lets user choose the notes source. For that, there is the Notion Page source and local file source.
- **QuizStarting:** Defines structures for Starting Quizzes from created Topics.
  - **QuizStartingChain:** Defines step and its inheritors for choosing, from which position to start the quiz and a builder for the quiz starting chain.
- **QuizGeneratorPresentation:** Contains mainly the UI components like the Main Page or Quiz Page. Also for Step components, there are special Forms implementing ChainStepForm<StepT, ProductT, BuilderT> : Form. This form holds the current Chain builder and the next form to be opened. When user presses Continue, the Chosen step is added to the Builder and the Builder is passed to the next form. Finaly, when the Building is finished, the Chain is built and executed.
  - **MainPage:** Defines the programs dashboard.
  - **QuizStarting:** Defiens UI elemets for satarting an existing Quiz from a Topic.
  - **TopicCreation:** Defiens UI elemets for creating new Topics.

## Troubleshooting

`

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **Error: Unable to parse notes file**
   Solution: Check if the notes file is in the correct format. Verify the question selector configuration.

2. **Error: Failed to connect to Notion API**
   Solution: Ensure the API key is valid and network connectivity is stable.

## Deployment

1. Package the Windows Forms application for desktop deployment
2. Creating a web version using JavaScript for broader accessibility is simple because of the design, only the frontend must be replaced and server setup

## Glossary

1. **Topic**: A collection of notes parsed into a structured format.
2. **Quiz**: A set of questions and answers derived from a topic.
3. **Question Marker**: CSS selector used to identify questions in HTML notes.
4. **Chain of Responsibility**: Design pattern used for quiz creation and starting processes.
5. **Notes**: Notes are some texts in a supported format containing the questions and answers. The questions are in some way marked. A way, that can be configured in the app before inputting the notes file. For instance, user could choose that in his notes, each important topic is marked in italics, or in textbooks, all numbered statements and their proofs are selected as questions.

## Future Enhancements

---

Future expansions will mostly be more steps to the Creation and Open Chains. For the Creation one, there will be:

- a Step, where user sees all found questions and can some exclude or edit there answers
- adding options for more questions dependency (you can set one question to be dependent in the DAG on another question)

For the opening Chain:

- adding option for AI checker, that will have user summarize his answer and some king of Language Model will decide, if the answer was good enough

And besides the Chains:

- analytics in the Quiz List like number of wrongly answered questions to correctly answered ratio. Or weather the Quiz was already finished
